## Inline Math Equation

The formula to calculate speed is:

$$
v = \frac{d}{t}
$$

Where:
 **$v$** is the speed (m/s)
 **$V$** is the distance (m)
 **$V$** is the time (s)

For example, if a car travels 100 meters in 10 seconds, the speed would be:

$$
v = \frac{100 \,\text{m}}{10 \, \text{s}} = 10 \, \text{m/s}
$$

## Footnote Example

This is the speed formula.[^1]

[^1]:Speed is a scalar quantity that refers to "how fast an object is moving"
